# Hangman_Game
Welcome to the Hangman Game project! 
This is a classic word guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word letter by letter. 
With each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman figure is drawn.
The goal is to guess the word before the entire hangman figure is completed.


**How to Play**
The game will display a series of underscores representing each letter in the word to guess. You'll be prompted to guess a letter.
Type in a letter and press Enter. The game will inform you if the letter is correct or incorrect. If incorrect, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
Keep guessing letters until you either guess the entire word (win) or the hangman figure is completed (lose).
After each game, you can choose to play again or exit.

**Features**
Randomly selects words from a predefined list.
Visually displays the hangman figure as you make incorrect guesses.
Tracks and displays the letters you've guessed.
Informs you about the outcome of the game (win or lose).
